| :warning: WARNING          |
|:---------------------------|
| This package has been obsoleted by the [Swift Argument Parser package](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser), which implements a far better approach. This package is preserved for posterity, but it is not being maintained. Using it isn't recommended in new Swift code, and I encourage maintainers of existing code that imports it to consider upgrading to Argument Parser.|

`OptionParser` is a Swift 4 package that helps you parse command-line arguments, with a declarative(-ish) interface.
